${project.name}

    This POM is the common parent of all of the {{{/plugins/}Maven plugins}}
    in the Apache Maven project.

* The <<<run-its>>> Profile

    This POM provides <<<run-its>>> profile for running Integration Tests to check real plugin execution.
    A default configuration for <<<maven-invoker-plugin>>> is defined, that every plugin needs to enhance
    to match its prerequisite. Then ITs are launched in every plugin with following command:

+---+
mvn -Prun-its verify
+---+


* Site Publication

    Since Maven plugins are always mono-module builds, this parent POM has configured <<<maven-scm-publish-plugin>>>
    {{{/plugins/maven-scm-publish-plugin/examples/one-module-configuration.html}mono module optimization}}
    to ease site build & deployment in only one integrated and simplified command:

+-----+
mvn -Preporting site-deploy
+-----+

* History

    As of version 38, this POM sets the Java source and target versions to 1.8. Thus, as any plugin (or other component)
    moved to version 38+ of this POM, it moves to requiring Java 1.8 (was Java 1.5 since version 21, Java 1.6 since
    version 27, and Java 1.7 since version 34).
