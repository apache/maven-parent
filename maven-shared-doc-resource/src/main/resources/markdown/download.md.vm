${project.name} ${project.version} is distributed in source format. Use a source archive if you intend to build
${project.name} yourself. Otherwise, simply use the ready-made binary artifacts from central repository.

In order to guard against corrupted downloads/installations, it is highly recommended to
[verify the signature](https://www.apache.org/dev/release-signing#verifying-signature)
of the release bundles against the public [KEYS](https://downloads.apache.org/maven/KEYS) used by the Apache Maven
developers.
