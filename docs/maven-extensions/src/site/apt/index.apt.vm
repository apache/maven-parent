${project.name}

    This POM is the common parent of all of the {{{/extensions/}Maven extensions}}
    in the Apache Maven project.

* The <<<run-its>>> Profile

    This POM provides <<<run-its>>> profile for running Integration Tests to check real extension execution.
    A default configuration for <<<maven-invoker-plugin>>> is defined, that every extension needs to enhance
    to match its prerequisite. Then ITs are launched in every extension with following command:

+---+
mvn -Prun-its verify
+---+


* Site Publication

    Since Maven extensions are always mono-module builds, this parent POM has configured <<<maven-scm-publish-plugin>>>
    {{{/plugins/maven-scm-publish-plugin/examples/one-module-configuration.html}mono module optimization}}
    to ease site build & deployment in only one integrated and simplified command:

+-----+
mvn -Preporting site-deploy
+-----+
